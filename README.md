•	*Sales Trend:* Hasn’t been optimistic which is evident from the downward trend throughout 2015. Moreover, there is a greater number of months showing a decrease in quantity sold as compared to those showing an increase. Sales peaked in July and troughed in October. 


•	*Least/Best-Selling Categories:* Chicken is the least popular while Classic is the most popular. Interestingly, even though Chicken is the least popular category, ‘The Barbecue Chicken Pizza’ emerged as the 2nd highest bought pizza potentially due to the desirable combination of barbecue chicken and sauce which are not found in other pizzas in that same category.


•	*Ideal Pizza Sizes:* Generally large for Supreme, Veggie and Chicken categories typically for sharing and small for Classic category for personal consumption which include the 2 best-selling pizzas in small size (e.g. ‘The Big Meat Pizza’ and ‘The Hawaiian Pizza’).


•	*Seasonality Across Categories:* Trend of declining quantity sold across all categories from August to October except for Supreme category which saw a sudden increase in October attributed to the highest contributor, ‘The Sicilian Pizza’ in terms of the quantity sold in October. This may reflect the impact of effective promotional campaigns for the aforementioned pizza and should be explored in greater detail. 


•	*Popular Toppings:* Among the top 10 best-selling pizzas, tomatoes and red peppers are the most commonly used ingredients, appearing in 50% and 40% of them, respectively. This information can guide the formulation of new pizza varieties moving forward.


•	*Worst Selling Pizza:* ‘The Brie Carre Pizza’ has recorded the lowest quantity sold and revenue which indicates an opportunity to review its ingredients and consider purchasing them less often or in smaller quantities to reduce inventory costs. Specifically, the ingredients that appear least frequently across the pizza recipes — and are included in the aforementioned pizza—are Prosciutto, Pears, Thyme, Brie Carre Cheese, and Caramelized Onions (i.e. in contrast to Garlic).

### Sales Performance: (Based On Revenue) <br><br>

•	*Major Revenue Contributors:* The top 5 best-selling pizzas which include ‘The Thai Chicken Pizza’, ‘The Barbecue Chicken Pizza’, ‘The California Chicken Pizza’, ‘The Classic Deluxe Pizza’ and ‘The Spicy Italian Pizza’ respectively, account for approximately 25% of the total revenue generated. Although pizzas in the Chicken category recorded the lowest total quantity sold, the 3 previously mentioned chicken-based pizzas already contributed 15.6% of total revenue. Thus, there is a need to focus on improving this category in terms of quantity sold.


•	*Low Number Of Orders Reaching AOV:* Only 36.6% of total orders reached the AOV of $38.31. This suggests the need for segmenting customers based on low to high spenders and devising more targeted strategies to boost overall AOV. 

---
### Customer Purchase Behavior: <br><br>
•	*Average Order Size:* Most orders consist of at least 2 pizzas, indicating that pizzas are often purchased for sharing, likely among small groups.


•	*Average Order Value:* The AOV is approximately $38.31 which can be further evaluated with the benchmark industry. Otherwise, the AOV is relatively stable across the months. 


•	*Product Combination:* Based on market basket analysis using the apriori algorithm, a lift value of 1.04 suggests that ‘The Thai Chicken Pizza’ and ‘The Hawaiian Pizza’ are 4% more likely to be bought together than by random chance. Although the association might not be very strong, it serves as a starting point for future cross-selling opportunities. 


•	*Most Preferred Day & Time Of Purchase:* Customers have a higher propensity to make a purchase during Friday Afternoon which is between 12pm and 6pm. 

---
###  Recommendations 


•	*Increase Sales Of Pizzas From Chicken Category:* When customers add ‘The Hawaiian Pizza’ into their cart, recommend them ‘The Thai Chicken Pizza’ as well since they are often bought together. Alternatively, as part of the Friday Afternoon special deals, discounts could be given to ‘The Barbecue Chicken Pizza’ (i.e. leverage on its popularity) with the purchase of any other pizzas from the Chicken category.


•	*Release Of New Pizzas:* For start, incorporate some of the most frequently found ingredients in the top 10 best-selling pizzas listed above and assess market interest of the new pizza. If the response is favorable, the pizza could be added to the permanent menu.


•	*Improve Non-Peak Period Sales:* In particular, roll out a breakfast menu which may or may not include pizzas to capture a wider audience. Essentially, the goal is to avoid limiting pizzas to being perceived solely as a lunch or dinner option.


•	*Reduce Inventory Costs:*  Since ‘The Brie Carre Pizza’ is the worst-performing pizza, it will be beneficial to either modify the recipe or at least reduce the order volume for the ingredients used in that pizza.


•	*Enhance Operational Efficiency:* Hire more part-time servers during the peak period in July to maintain prompt food service to prevent customer complaints and minimize fixed labor costs (i.e. compared to hiring full-timers).
